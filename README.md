# Sudoku solver

This project is a sudoku solver in react, but it can work as a sudoku game as well
to run , open terminal and run:

## run with `npm start`

So the game itself can work as normal sudoku game. I implimented features like:

- Marking the number of focus
- Marking mistakes
- It currently has 2 hard-coded puzzles (I will research into puzzle generation or pull from API)
